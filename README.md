## Predicting Bike Rentals using RandomForest

Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day.

We'll try to predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given.
### Introduction to DataSet:

You can download the data from the [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

 - The Dataset contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day.
